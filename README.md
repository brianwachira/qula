### Commit Conventions

When pushing or merging PRs in to main, your commit messages should follow something like `[type]: change this, add that`, where the commit `{type}` can be one of the following:

| Commit Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `build` | creating a new release |
| `chore` | assorted minor changes |
| `ci` | updates related to the ci process |
| `docs` | documentation updates |
| `feat` | new elements; major features and updates |
| `fix` | bug fixes; security updates |
| `perf` | performance improvements |
| `refactor` | general refactors |
| `revert` | reverting a previous commit |
| `style` | aesthetic changes |
| `test` | adding or updating existing tests |

You can also optionally note the `[scope]` of your changes in an additional parenthetical. If your changes require a longer description, feel free to add a commit message with further details! Combining all of these together, you might end up with something like:

```text
feat[api-explorer]: add color variants

- some more details
- about the changes
```
